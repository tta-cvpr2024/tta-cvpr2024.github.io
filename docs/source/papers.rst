Accepted Papers
===============

Our workshop includes a proceedings/archival track and a community/non-archival track.
We are excited to host poster and lightning talk presentations of all contributed papers in both tracks.

- For the poster session each paper has a number in 182‚Äì193.
- For the lightning talks each paper has one slide in one minute in the ‚ö°Ô∏è `lightning talk deck`_.

- üèÜ Proceedings Best Paper: Test-time Specialization of Dynamic Neural Networks by Leroux et al.
- üèÜ Community Best Paper: Persistent Test-time Adaptation in Recurring Testing Scenarios by Hoang et al.
